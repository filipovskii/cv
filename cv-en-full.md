###### Work

*   **10.2016-12.2017**<br/>
    **Product Manager at [Productive Mobile](https://productivemobile.com)
    (B2B software startup)**

    As a Product Manager I was making sure we're building the right thing.

    I took over Product after being a senior engineer for two years. At the
    time we have started doing pilots with customers, our platform was
    covering about 30% of use cases and we have just undergone a major change
    in organization's structure. After one year in product, here is what we've
    achieved:

    * 30% of DAX companies are paid customers or piloting with Productive
      Mobile;

    * Platform coverage went from approximately 30% of use cases to 90%;

    * Time to deliver 80% of the use cases we support brought down from
      several weeks to several days or even hours;

    * Changes to the platform we've made now allow building *any mobile
      application* fast, extending beyond mobilization;

    * Collaboratively we've set up the goal of the company and metrics
      to measure our success as an organization as well as measure each
      department separately. It's hard to quantify these things, but I
      believe it allowed us to focus and improved communication between
      departments;

    * Together with engineering we've brought down uncertainty in lead
      times. Before it could take anything from a day to a month to
      finish a feature. With the changes tickets got to production
      within 8 days from the time engineer takes the ticket.


*   **09.2014-10.2016**<br/>
    **Full-stack Javascript Developer at [Productive
    Mobile](https://productivemobile.com)**

    * In a small team we've build the product from the ground up;

    * As a senior member of the team, I helped set up processes and make
      technical descisions. As a result we have received the highest
      rating during a tech due diligence from an independent contractor;

    * Among other things I was responsible for hiring and onboarding
      people to the engineering team. We were able to hire brilliant
      developers and QA engineers that formed the core of the team.

*   **2011-2014**<br/>
    **Tech consultant / full-stack developer in various startups**

    During that time I was working in a number of companies that don't
    exist anymore. We've built products in online advertising, education
    and high-frequency trading. It was great fun.

    I'd be happy to provide details upon request.
